telstar
========

Simple-as-possible, personal link shortener with Bottle and Redis. Uses Redis' INCR function for an interesting change from the usual BASE and random stuff. 

Requires: 
 
* [Redis](http://github.com/antirez/redis "Redis")

* [Bottle](http://github.com/defnull/bottle "Bottle")

* [redis-py](http://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py "redis-py")

telstar is directly inspired by Dave Jeffery's tinchy, Leah Culver's tinytinyurl, and also by Cake's song Daria (which was playing in the couple of minute when telstar was written).
